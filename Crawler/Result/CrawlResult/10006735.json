        "Hi, Stranger. It’s been a while. I miss you. It’s OK. You can look my butt. I feel like I can really be vulnerable around you. Do you like this tree I made? Cool, right? I think it’s cool.It’s so hard to make things sometimes, you know. It just takes so much mental energy, and it’s so tired. I just want to stay here and relax with you.Wow, check out the sunset.So nice to stop, and take all this in.It makes you enjoy being alive.Even you.I love looking at you.I want remember all your shapes.Ah, beautiful.I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately. I see you trying to do so many things at once,worrying about the decisions you made,worrying that you said wrong things to someone.You’re so hard on yourself.But you’re wonderful, and worthy being loved.You really are.You just have to let yourself believe it.Well, I know you are busy, and probably have to go.But I’m glad to see you for a minute.I love you."
